DevOps is a process and not a culture.
DevOps is nothing but Agile.
There should be a separate DevOps group.
DevOps solves every problem.
DevOps equates to developers running a production environment.
DevOps follows Development-driven management
DevOps does not focus much on development.
As we are a unique organization, we don’t follow the masses and hence we won’t
implement DevOps.
We don’t have the right set of people, hence we cant implement DevOps culture.
